[Michele GIUGLIANO](https://www.giugliano.info/cv) lectures on _Computational Neurobiology_, during the winter semester of the first year PhD course at [SISSA](http://phdneurobiology.sissa.it).

This website provides material and online resources for the course, which is meant as a graduate introduction to the biophysics of excitable membranes and to elementary quantitative neuronal modelling, mostly at the cell levels. These are elements any researcher in Neuroscience should have a solid grasp of, especially today where large-scale initiatives are launched world-wide to dissect cells, networks, systems, and behavior with a multidisciplinary approach, where computational neuroscience is a key tool besides _wet_ experimental techniques. 

The various topics of the course are presented with in mind a non-specialist audience, rather at ease with neurobiology but inexperienced in the quantitative language of biophysics, modelling, and unaware of modenr computational approaches in Neuroscience.

The course is delivered as "blended learning". This means that both online content, to be watched and studied at students' own pace and time, as well as live interactions in class with the lecturer are planned.

Ample time is reserved on SISSA's course schedule (see [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/9497a9da52f84297a0d724de394762ae@sissa.it/580bd1f37edd4cd9afc26027815ceffe18124062637756405418/calendar.html)), so that formal time is "booked" for both blended learning and "live interactions".

Students are encouraged to watch the individual videos segments ahead of schedule, at their own pace.

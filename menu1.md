# Mathematical refresher and preliminaries (~5h)

**Note:** The overheads are available

for download.

\toc

The first module of the course is optional and delivered as "online-only"
material. It refreshes elementary mathematical concepts, which you should
already be familiar with from high-school and from the first years of your
undergraduate training. It also introduces preliminary math tools, which will
become relevant during the second part of the course.

Videos and learning material have been made available to you in advance, for
your self-paced independent learning. A total of 5 hours have been booked on the
course calendar during the first week, so that you do have official scheduled
time to watch and study the videos, and play with the interactive examples.

Below you find the table of content, with the individual videos. Note that
videos have been "split" into three parts (i.e. part A, part B, and part C), and
further decomposed in smaller "bits" you should be able to digest easily.
